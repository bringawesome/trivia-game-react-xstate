# xstate-examples

## Explanation
This repo serves as a resource for any developer curious about [state machines](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html) and [statecharts](https://statecharts.github.io). I've heard developers that _want_ to use state machines, but have not found the "perfect reason" to utilize them. Now the "perfect reason" is easier to find. ðŸ˜‰
